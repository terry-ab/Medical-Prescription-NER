The patient believed this was secondary to\r\nfluid overload. One week prior to presentation the patient\r\ncomplained of subjective fevers, cough productive of yellow\r\nsputum. His nephrologist gave him a five-day course of\r\nazithromycin. The patient had persistent symptoms and was\r\nstarted on levofloxacin by his PCP two days prior to admission.\r\nThe patient had a history of tylenol use 3g/day for 5 days prior\r\nto admission for fever, body aches. The day prior to admission\r\nthe patient began to experience worsened abdominal pain\r\nassociated with nausea, a few episodes of vomiting,\r\nnonbilious/nonbloody, and diarrhea 4-5 times per day, watery,\r\nnonbloody.In the ED the patient was found to be hypotensive with lactate\r\nof 5.6 and a code sepsis was called. He was given Vanco, Flagyl\r\nand Zosyn for presumed infection. He was given Decadron for\r\npresumed adrenal insufficiency. He was also given Calcium\r\ngluconate, sodium bicarbonate, Insulin and D50 for hyperkalemia.\r\nA CVL was placed and he received 3L of NS with normalization of\r\npressures. He was transferred to the MICU.In the MICU the patient's LFTs were significantly elevated and\r\npeaked at ALT 3016, AST 2956, LDH [**2064**], INR 4.3 on [**12-25**]. This\r\nwas thought to be secondary to shock liver in the setting of\r\nhypotension/sepsis versus tylenol toxicity despite negative\r\nserum tylenol. LFTs subsequently trending down.Upon transfer to the floor, the patient continues to complain of\r\ncough productive of yellow sputum. Denies chest pain, shortness\r\nof breath. The patient denied any fevers/chills, abdominal pain,\r\nnausea, vomiting. Diarrhea improving. Denies dysuria/hematuria;\r\nminimal urine output while on HD. Denies lightheadedness. Denies\r\nmyalgias/arthralgias.
